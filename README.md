- Studied the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities'n how they can be exploited.
- Studied the Penetration Testing Execution Process and the activities that are always involved.
- Gained an understanding of the networking concepts, i.e, VLANS, Switching, Routing, IP addressing, OSI Model and TCP/IP model.

#### Fourth Week: 17/07/2023 - 21/07/2023 ####
- Routing simulations in GNS3 software,including static and dynamic
- Simulating networks using Routing protocols. IS-IS, OSPRF
- Studied Wlan Technologies
- Use of developer tools to do code analysis
- Using nmap to scan for ports on an remote machine and identifying the servers and applications running.
- Intercepting and modifying traffic using Burp Suite.
