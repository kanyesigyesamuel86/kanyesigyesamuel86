I am currently attending idustrial training at RENU. I have so far gained great insights and knowledge as described below.

        -I as well was able to create containers in Docker and add Ubuntu and Debian images.   
        -I remotely accessed the Debian Virtual Machine from the host machine using SSH.  


#### Second week: ####
        -I installed Ubuntu Server and Windows 2019 server, each on a remote Virtual Machine using Real VNC Viewer.  
        -I then configured SSH remote access using public key authentication and disabling password authentication to create an additional layer of security
        -I installed docker on Ubuntu Server ,and then installed pihole in docker and enabled remote access to pihole using Pihole Web interface.  
        -I installed Arch Linux on a Virtual Machine in VirtualBox.
